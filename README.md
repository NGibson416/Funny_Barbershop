An assignment I did during college I that I like

It's an original concept I came up with for an assignment, I enjoy lighthearted content and I like to imagine 
my teachers reaction after marking 100 generic apps using his concepts and photos then opening this
and it is just completely wacky haircuts.

Structurually pretty solid & minimalistic and I honestly think would be a great layout for 
a small business such as a barbershop, where the whole point of the website is to direct
foot traffic to the location for a sevice, not to sell products online or run 
relentless ad campaigns.

I Hope you enjoy the wacky barbershop
